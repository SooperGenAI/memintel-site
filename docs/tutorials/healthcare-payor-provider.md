# Tutorial: Healthcare Payor-Provider Intelligence

A walkthrough of three critical intelligence use cases in the payor-provider space — claims fraud detection, provider network compliance monitoring, and prior authorization management. Each is examined from both the payor and provider perspective, and each follows the same Memintel architecture with domain-specific primitives, concepts, and conditions.

:::note What you'll build
Three deterministic monitoring systems covering the most operationally and financially significant problems at the intersection of health insurance and healthcare delivery — with every decision auditable, reproducible, and defensible under CMS, OIG, and state regulatory scrutiny.
:::

## Why Healthcare Needs Memintel

The payor-provider relationship is one of the most complex in any industry. Payors must evaluate billions of claims annually against evolving clinical policies, regulatory requirements, and fraud patterns. Providers must navigate authorization requirements, billing rules, and value-based contract metrics that change continuously.

Both sides share the same fundamental problem: **decisions that are made correctly today may become incorrect tomorrow** — because the regulatory environment changed, because a provider's billing pattern shifted, because a clinical policy was updated, or because a new fraud typology was published by CMS or the OIG.

Current systems handle this badly. Claims adjudication is largely rule-based and reactive. Provider credentialing is calendar-driven rather than event-driven. Prior authorization is manual and inconsistent. The result is billions of dollars in improper payments, provider abrasion from inconsistent authorization decisions, and compliance exposure on both sides.

Memintel addresses this by separating the **discovery of clinical and compliance meaning** (which requires contextual, temporal, and cross-memory reasoning) from the **execution of payor-provider decisions** (which must be deterministic, consistent, and fully auditable).

## The Three Roles

| Role | Who they are | What they do |
|---|---|---|
| **Data Engineer** | Health IT / data team | Builds data pipelines, writes resolver functions, delivers typed primitives |
| **Admin** | Chief Medical Officer / VP Compliance | Maintains config files — primitives, guardrails — governs clinical policy thresholds |
| **User** | Claims analyst / network manager / care manager | Expresses intent via dashboard — creates, monitors, and manages tasks |

## Use Case 1 — Claims Fraud Detection

### The Problem

*Perspective: Payor*

Healthcare fraud costs the US healthcare system an estimated $300 billion annually. The most sophisticated fraud is not a single anomalous claim — it is a pattern of individually plausible claims that collectively reveal upcoding, unbundling, phantom billing, or referral kickback schemes. Current rules-based systems catch obvious violations but miss the subtle patterns that account for the majority of improper payments.

The challenge is contextual: a billing pattern that looks suspicious for a primary care physician is completely normal for an oncologist. A procedure billed 40 times a month by a rural solo practitioner is an anomaly. The same procedure billed 40 times a month by a high-volume urban specialist may be entirely appropriate. Context — specialty, geography, patient population, historical pattern — determines what is normal.

### The Architecture Boundary

```
Raw claims data  →  Signal Extraction  →  Primitives  →  Memintel
(claims, EHR,        (pattern analysis,    (typed,          (deterministic
 eligibility,         LLM on notes,         normalised)       evaluation)
 provider data)       peer benchmarking)

    entityScope: "all_active_providers",
    delivery: { type: "webhook", endpoint: "https://myapp.com/hooks/fraud-upcoding" }

### What the Alert Looks Like

```
🚨 Claims Integrity Alert — Upcoding Pattern Detected

Provider:   Dr. Sarah Chen, MD (NPI: 1234567890)
Specialty:  Internal Medicine — Suburban Chicago
Period:     Q4 2023 (Oct–Dec)

Billing Pattern vs Specialty Peers:
  99215 (High complexity): 68% of E&M claims  (peer median: 31%)
  99214 (Mod complexity):  28% of E&M claims  (peer median: 52%)
  99213 (Low complexity):   4% of E&M claims  (peer median: 17%)

Upcoding signal:   0.79  (threshold: 0.75)
Peer deviation:    0.71  (threshold: 0.70)
OIG watchlist:     No
License active:    Yes

Estimated overpayment (90 days):  $47,200

→ Request medical records   → Prepayment review   → Refer to SIU
```

### The Fraud Detection Advantage

The `provider.upcoding_signal` primitive compares the provider's billing distribution against their **specialty and geography peer group** — not against a global average. An oncologist legitimately bills a high proportion of complex codes. Comparing them to a primary care median would produce false positives constantly. The peer-adjusted comparison is what makes this genuinely useful. The primitive captures this adjustment; Memintel evaluates it deterministically.

## Use Case 2 — Provider Network Compliance

### The Problem

*Perspective: Payor*

Health plans are contractually and regulatorily obligated to maintain networks of qualified, accessible providers. CMS, state insurance commissioners, and accreditation bodies like NCQA audit network adequacy — whether patients have sufficient access to in-network providers across specialties and geographies. Network compliance failures result in regulatory sanctions, member grievances, and CMS star rating impacts.

At the same time, individual provider compliance within the network is a continuous obligation — licenses expire, board certifications lapse, malpractice coverage lapses, credentialing requirements change. A provider whose credentials were current at contracting may no longer meet network participation requirements twelve months later.

Current systems are predominantly calendar-driven — providers are recredentialed every two years regardless of whether their circumstances have changed. Events that should trigger immediate review (a license suspension, a malpractice judgment, an OIG exclusion) are often discovered weeks or months after they occur.

### What the Alert Looks Like — License Expiry

```
⚠️ Network Compliance Alert — License Expiry Approaching

Provider:     Dr. James Park, MD (NPI: 9876543210)
Specialty:    Cardiology
Network:      PPO Gold, HMO Standard
Members:      847 attributed members

License Expiry:   42 days  (expires: 2024-04-28)
Board Cert:       Active  (expires: 2025-09-15)
Malpractice:      Active
OIG Status:       Clear
NPDB:             No adverse actions

Action required: Provider must submit renewed license
before 2024-04-28 or will be suspended from network

→ Send provider notice   → Update credentialing portal   → Flag for follow-up
```

### What the Alert Looks Like — OIG Exclusion

```
🔴 URGENT — Network Provider OIG Exclusion

Provider:     Dr. Michael Torres, MD (NPI: 5551234567)
Specialty:    Pain Management
Exclusion:    Added to OIG LEIE 2024-03-15 14:30 UTC
Reason:       Program-related conviction

Impact:
  • Federal programs: CANNOT bill Medicare/Medicaid effective immediately
  • Claims submitted after exclusion date: subject to repayment
  • Network contract: termination required under CMS conditions

Members affected:    312 attributed
Claims in flight:    23 claims submitted today — HOLD pending review

Action required IMMEDIATELY — federal law prohibits payment
to excluded providers from date of exclusion

→ Suspend provider NOW   → Hold in-flight claims   → Notify compliance
```

### The Network Compliance Advantage

The OIG exclusion alert demonstrates the event-driven advantage. Current credentialing systems check the OIG list on a monthly or quarterly schedule. A provider excluded on March 15th might not be flagged until the next monthly batch run — in the interim, the plan may continue paying claims to an excluded provider, creating federal overpayment liability. Memintel evaluates against the OIG list as of the current timestamp, event-driven on each update, eliminating this exposure gap entirely.

## Use Case 3 — Prior Authorization Management

### The Problem

*Perspective: Both Payor and Provider*

Prior authorization is one of the most significant sources of friction and financial risk in the payor-provider relationship. For payors, authorization decisions must be clinically appropriate, consistent, and compliant with CMS and state timeliness requirements. For providers, authorization denials are a leading cause of claim denials, delayed care, and administrative burden.

The problem has two sides:

**Payor side:** Authorization decisions must be made consistently — the same clinical scenario must receive the same determination regardless of which reviewer handles it. Current processes are highly variable and difficult to audit.

**Provider side:** Authorization status must be actively monitored — an authorization approved today may have conditions, expiry dates, or unit limits that, if exceeded, result in denial. Providers often discover authorization issues only at the point of claim submission, after the service has already been delivered.

### User Creates Tasks — Payor Perspective

```typescript
// Authorization operations manager (payor) creates tasks

// Task 1 — Timeliness compliance — urgent requests
const urgentTimeliness = await client.tasks.create({
    intent: "Alert me when an urgent prior authorization request is approaching the CMS 72-hour timeliness limit",
    entityScope: "all_pending_urgent_auth_requests",
    delivery: { type: "webhook", endpoint: "https://myapp.com/hooks/auth-timeliness" }
});
// Resolves to: hours_pending > 48 AND urgency_level = urgent

// Task 2 — Policy change impact on pending auths
const policyChange = await client.tasks.create({
    intent: "Alert me when a clinical policy change affects procedures with pending authorizations",
    entityScope: "all_active_procedures",
    delivery: { type: "webhook", endpoint: "https://myapp.com/hooks/auth-policy-change" }
});
// Resolves to: procedure.policy_change_flag = true
// Event-driven — fires when policy is updated
```

### User Creates Tasks — Provider Perspective

```typescript
// Revenue cycle manager (provider) creates tasks

// Task 1 — Authorization expiry warning
const authExpiry = await client.tasks.create({
    intent: "Alert me when an active authorization is approaching expiry with pending services",
    entityScope: "all_active_authorizations",
    delivery: { type: "webhook", endpoint: "https://myapp.com/hooks/auth-expiry" }
});
// Resolves to: days_to_expiry < 7 AND pending_claims_at_risk > 0

// Task 2 — Unit exhaustion warning
const unitExhaustion = await client.tasks.create({
    intent: "Alert me when authorization units are nearly exhausted",
    entityScope: "all_active_authorizations",
    delivery: { type: "webhook", endpoint: "https://myapp.com/hooks/auth-units" }
});
// Resolves to: units_utilization_rate > 0.90

// Task 3 — Authorization required but missing
const missingAuth = await client.tasks.create({
    intent: "Alert me when a scheduled procedure requires authorization and none is on file",
    entityScope: "all_scheduled_procedures",
    delivery: { type: "webhook", endpoint: "https://myapp.com/hooks/auth-missing" }
});
```

### What the Alerts Look Like — Provider Side

```
⚠️ Authorization Alert — Units Nearly Exhausted

Patient:        Mary Johnson  (MRN: 4821039)
Authorization:  AUTH-2024-88823
Service:        Physical Therapy (CPT 97110)
Authorized:     24 units   |   Used: 22 units   |   Remaining: 2 units
Expiry:         2024-05-31  (67 days remaining)

Scheduled upcoming sessions: 4
Units at risk: 2 sessions will exceed authorization

Action required: Submit extension request before next session
→ Request extension   → Contact payor   → Update schedule

---

⚠️ Authorization Alert — Expiry with Claims at Risk

Patient:        Robert Chen  (MRN: 7723041)
Authorization:  AUTH-2024-44201
Service:        Home Health (G0151)
Expiry:         5 days  (expires: 2024-03-20)

Pending claims at risk: 3 claims ($4,200 estimated)
Last renewal submitted: Not yet submitted

→ Submit renewal NOW   → Contact case manager   → Review schedule
```

### The Prior Auth Advantage

The `auth.pending_claims_at_risk` primitive is what makes provider-side monitoring genuinely actionable. Most authorization management systems show you that an auth is expiring. This system shows you that an expiring auth has 3 pending claims worth $4,200 that will be denied if the auth is not renewed — quantifying the financial impact and creating urgency proportional to actual risk. The Concept layer computes this combination automatically from the expiry and pending claims primitives.

## The System Response Loop (All Three Use Cases)

```
Trigger: Schedule (hourly/daily) OR event-driven
  (new claim submitted, OIG list updated, auth status changed,
   policy updated, NPDB report received)
          ↓
For each entity in scope:
  Memintel calls resolvers with (entity_id, timestamp)
  Resolvers fetch point-in-time values:
    → Claims DB: billing patterns, procedure volumes
    → Credentialing system: license and certification status
    → OIG/NPDB APIs: exclusion and adverse action status
    → Authorization system: expiry dates, unit utilization
    → Clinical policy engine: criteria match scores
  Concept computation runs
  Condition evaluates
          ↓
  If condition fires:
    Alert delivered to analyst / care manager / revenue cycle team
    Decision logged with full audit trail
    Workflow action triggered (hold claims, send notice, escalate)
          ↓
  If not: Decision logged. No action.
          ↓
Next trigger
```

### Event-driven vs scheduled evaluation

| Use Case | Best trigger | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| Claims fraud | **Daily batch** for pattern analysis; **real-time** for impossible day flags | Patterns require accumulation; impossible day flags are immediate |
| Network compliance — OIG | **Event-driven** on OIG list publication | Federal liability begins at exclusion date, not detection date |
| Network compliance — license | **Daily** with **30/60/90 day** early warning | License expiry is gradual but non-negotiable |
| Prior auth — provider | **Daily** + **event-driven** on claim submission | Expiry is gradual; missing auth is immediate |
| Prior auth — payor timeliness | **Hourly** for urgent requests | CMS timeliness penalties are time-critical |

---

## Task Management

### User controls

```typescript
// View all active compliance monitoring tasks
const tasks = await client.tasks.list({ owner: "current_user" });

// Pause fraud detection during claims system migration
await client.tasks.pause("tsk_fraud_upcoding", {
    reason: "Claims system migration — data quality unreliable 2024-03-15 to 2024-03-17"
});

// Check alert performance
const taskDetail = await client.tasks.get("tsk_auth_expiry");
console.log(`Fired ${taskDetail.fire_count_30d} times in last 30 days`);
console.log(`Avg days lead time before auth expiry: ${taskDetail.avg_lead_time_days}`);
```

### Admin visibility

```typescript
// Admin view — all tasks across all departments
const allTasks = await adminClient.tasks.list();

// Compliance audit — which condition version was active on a specific date?
// Critical for CMS audit response
const versionHistory = await adminClient.conditions.versionHistory({
    conditionId: "auth_request.timeliness_breach_risk",
    from: "2024-01-01",
    to: "2024-03-31"
});
// Returns: which version was active on each date during the audit period

// Suspend tasks if a data source is unreliable
await adminClient.tasks.suspend("tsk_network_adequacy", {
    reason: "Provider directory API outage — adequacy data unreliable"
});
```

---

## Calibration

### Claims fraud — driven by SIU investigation outcomes

```typescript
// Provider was flagged but investigation found no fraud — false positive
await client.feedback.decision({
    conditionId: "provider.high_fraud_risk",
    conditionVersion: "1.1",
    entity: "provider_npi_1234567890",
    timestamp: "2024-01-15T00:00:00Z",
    feedback: "false_positive",
    note: "SIU investigation closed — provider serves complex patient population justifying high complexity codes"
});
```

### Network compliance — driven by regulatory audit outcomes

```typescript
// CMS audit found network adequacy gap that was not flagged — false negative
await client.feedback.decision({
    conditionId: "specialty_area.network_adequacy_insufficient",
    conditionVersion: "1.0",
    entity: "cardiology_rural_southwest",
    timestamp: "2023-12-31T00:00:00Z",
    feedback: "false_negative",
    note: "CMS audit found inadequacy — threshold too conservative for rural geographies"
});
```

### Prior auth — driven by denial rates and appeals outcomes

```typescript
// Auth was not flagged as at-risk but claim was denied — false negative
await client.feedback.decision({
    conditionId: "auth.expiry_at_risk",
    conditionVersion: "1.0",
    entity: "auth_2024_44201",
    timestamp: "2024-03-10T00:00:00Z",
    feedback: "false_negative",
    note: "Auth expired and claim denied — 7-day warning was insufficient for this service type"
});
// Calibration may recommend: extend warning window for home health services to 14 days
```

## Application Context

Before creating primitives and tasks for this use case, define the application context. The payor and provider perspectives benefit from distinct contexts.

**Payor context (claims fraud and network compliance):**

```json
{
  "domain": {
    "description": "Healthcare payor compliance intelligence for a regional health plan. We monitor provider billing patterns for fraud and abuse, and network compliance for credentialing and adequacy.",
    "entities": [
      { "name": "provider",  "description": "a network-contracted healthcare provider or facility" },
      { "name": "claim",     "description": "an individual claim submitted for adjudication" },
      { "name": "patient",   "description": "a health plan member receiving care" }
    ],
    "decisions": ["fraud_alert", "network_suspension", "credentialing_review", "adequacy_gap"]
  },
  "behavioural": {
    "data_cadence": "batch",
    "meaningful_windows": { "min": "30d", "max": "365d" },
    "regulatory": ["HIPAA", "CMS", "OIG", "NCQA"]
  },
  "semantic_hints": [
    { "term": "peer group",    "definition": "providers with the same specialty code and geographic market" },
    { "term": "high complexity","definition": "CPT codes 99214 or 99215 for E&M services" },
    { "term": "outlier",       "definition": "above the 85th percentile of the peer group distribution" }
  ],
  "calibration_bias": {
    "false_negative_cost": "high",
    "false_positive_cost": "medium"
  }
}
```

**Provider context (prior authorisation):**

```json
{
  "domain": {
    "description": "Prior authorisation management for a multi-specialty physician group. We track authorisation status and expiry to prevent claim denials.",
    "entities": [
      { "name": "authorisation", "description": "a payor-issued authorisation for a specific service" },
      { "name": "patient",       "description": "a patient with scheduled or active services" }
    ],
    "decisions": ["expiry_risk", "unit_exhaustion_risk", "missing_auth"]
  },
  "behavioural": {
    "data_cadence": "batch",
    "meaningful_windows": { "min": "1d", "max": "30d" },
    "regulatory": ["CMS", "HIPAA"]
  },
  "semantic_hints": [
    { "term": "at risk",   "definition": "auth expires before all scheduled services are completed" },
    { "term": "exhausted", "definition": "units used equals or exceeds units authorised" }
  ],
  "calibration_bias": {
    "false_negative_cost": "high",
    "false_positive_cost": "low"
  }
}
```

The provider context sets `false_negative_cost: high` and `false_positive_cost: low` — a missed expiry results in a claim denial after service delivery, which is costly and irreversible. The semantic hint for "at risk" means the compiler correctly interprets "alert me when an auth is at risk" as a trajectory evaluation against scheduled services, not just a days-remaining threshold.

## Why This Architecture Fits Healthcare

All three use cases share the same structural property: **the compliance determination requires evaluating internal clinical and operational state against an evolving external regulatory and clinical environment.**

Claims fraud requires evaluating a provider's billing pattern against both their own history (internal) and their specialty peer group and current OIG typologies (external). A rule fires on a single transaction. Memintel detects a pattern.

Network compliance requires evaluating a provider's credentialing state against both their current credentials (internal) and the current OIG exclusion list, NPDB reports, and CMS adequacy standards (external). A calendar-based system recredentials every two years. Memintel detects the moment something changes.

Prior authorization requires evaluating authorization status against both current utilization (internal) and current clinical policy requirements, CMS timeliness rules, and procedure coverage determinations (external). A claims system discovers the problem at denial. Memintel surfaces it before the service is delivered.

The auditability requirement is especially significant in healthcare. CMS audits, OIG investigations, and state insurance commissioner reviews all require documentation of when decisions were made, on what basis, and whether processes were consistently followed. Memintel's immutable audit trail — logging every evaluation with its exact concept version, condition version, primitive values, and timestamp — satisfies this documentation requirement automatically, without requiring forensic reconstruction after the fact.
