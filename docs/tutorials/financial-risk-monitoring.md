# Tutorial: Financial Risk Monitoring

A walkthrough of three of the most critical risk monitoring use cases for financial institutions — Anti-Money Laundering transaction monitoring, credit risk and loan portfolio surveillance, and capital adequacy monitoring under Basel. Each follows the same Memintel architecture but with domain-specific primitives, concepts, and conditions.

:::note What you'll build
Three deterministic monitoring systems that continuously evaluate a financial institution's risk state against an evolving regulatory and market environment — with every decision auditable, reproducible, and explainable.
:::

## Why Financial Risk Needs Memintel

Financial institutions face a specific class of risk problem that conventional systems handle badly. The risk is not just about what is happening now — it is about how the current state of a customer, portfolio, or balance sheet relates to an evolving set of external signals, regulatory thresholds, and historical patterns.

Current approaches share a common failure mode: they are **reactive and rule-based**. A transaction monitoring system fires when a transaction crosses a threshold. A credit system flags when a loan-to-value ratio breaches a limit. A capital system reports when a ratio falls below a floor. All of these are point-in-time checks against static rules.

What they cannot do:

- Detect gradual deterioration before a threshold is breached
- Evaluate context — a transaction that looks suspicious in isolation may be normal given a customer's established pattern
- React to external signals — a regulatory update, a market event, a peer institution enforcement action
- Maintain an audit trail that is legally defensible in enforcement proceedings

Memintel solves this by separating the **discovery of risk** (which requires contextual, temporal, and cross-memory reasoning) from the **execution of risk decisions** (which must be deterministic, auditable, and reproducible).

## The Three Roles

The same role structure applies across all three use cases.

| Role | Who they are | What they do |
|---|---|---|
| **Data Engineer** | Risk technology / data team | Builds data pipelines, writes resolver functions, delivers typed primitives |
| **Admin** | Chief Risk Officer / Compliance Officer | Maintains config files — primitives, guardrails — and governs task visibility and calibration |
| **User** | Risk analyst / compliance officer | Expresses intent via dashboard or bot — creates, monitors, and manages tasks |

## Use Case 1 — AML Transaction Monitoring

### The Problem

AML compliance requires continuous monitoring of customer transactions for patterns indicating money laundering, terrorist financing, or other financial crimes. The challenge is both scale — large banks process millions of transactions daily — and contextual complexity. A transaction that looks suspicious in isolation may be completely normal given a customer's established behavior. Conversely, a series of individually unremarkable transactions may reveal a sophisticated laundering pattern when evaluated collectively over time.

Current rule-based systems generate enormous false positive rates — industry estimates suggest 90–95% of AML alerts are false positives. This consumes vast compliance analyst time and paradoxically reduces the effectiveness of genuine detection.

### The Architecture Boundary

// Compliance officer via AML monitoring dashboard
const task = await client.tasks.create({
    intent: "Alert me when a transaction shows high risk of structuring or unusual pattern relative to customer baseline",
    entityScope: "all_active_transactions",
    delivery: {
        type: "webhook",
        endpoint: "https://myapp.com/hooks/aml-alert"

    dryRun: true
});

// System resolves to composite condition:
// structuring_signal > 0.85 OR value_vs_baseline > 15x
// weighted by customer jurisdiction risk and typology match
```

### What the Alert Looks Like

```
🚨 AML Alert — Unusual Transaction Pattern

Customer:    ABC Trading Ltd (customer_id: cust_7823)
Transaction: $847,000  (ref: TXN_92847)
Filed:       2024-03-15 14:23 UTC

Signals:
  • Transaction value: 12.4x customer 90-day average
  • Structuring signal: 0.71 (threshold: 0.65)
  • Counterparty jurisdiction: Grey-listed (FATF)
  • Narrative risk: 0.63 — reference contains unusual routing language

Risk score: 0.84 / threshold: 0.65

→ Open SAR workflow   → Mark reviewed   → Escalate to MLRO
```

### The AML Advantage

The critical difference from rule-based systems: the `value_vs_baseline_ratio` primitive means that a $10,000 transaction from a customer whose baseline is $100,000 scores very differently from a $10,000 transaction from a customer whose baseline is $800. The same transaction value can be perfectly normal or highly suspicious — context determines which. Memintel evaluates this contextually and deterministically.

---

## Use Case 2 — Credit Risk and Loan Portfolio Monitoring

### The Problem

Credit risk monitoring requires continuous surveillance of loan portfolios for deteriorating borrower health, changing collateral values, covenant breaches, and concentration risks. The challenge is that credit deterioration is typically gradual — a borrower who will default in six months often shows subtle warning signs months earlier that individually look unremarkable but collectively indicate stress.

Current systems flag covenant breaches reactively, when it is often too late for meaningful intervention. Memintel enables proactive early warning — detecting the trajectory toward a breach before it occurs.

```

### What the Alert Looks Like

```
⚠️ Credit Early Warning — DSCR Deterioration

Borrower:  Acme Manufacturing Ltd
Loan:      $24M term loan (loan_id: LN_4821)
Officer:   J. Martinez

DSCR Trend (last 4 quarters):
  Q1 2023: 2.41  Q2 2023: 2.18  Q3 2023: 1.87  Q4 2023: 1.52

Change: -0.89 over 4 quarters (-37%)  |  Covenant floor: 1.25
Current headroom to covenant: 21.6%   |  Trajectory: 2 quarters to breach

Contributing signals:
  • Revenue down 12% YoY (from financial submission)
  • Management sentiment score: 0.31 (cautious tone in Q3 commentary)
  • Sector stress signal: 0.58 (manufacturing headwinds)

→ Schedule borrower review   → Update watch list   → Model covenant scenarios
```

### The Credit Risk Advantage

The `dscr_trend_4q` primitive registered as `time_series<float>` is what enables the early warning capability. A point-in-time DSCR of 1.52 looks fine — it is above the covenant floor of 1.25. But evaluated as a time series using a `change` strategy, the -37% decline over four quarters is a strong deterioration signal. Memintel detects the trajectory, not just the current position. This is the difference between reactive covenant monitoring and genuine early warning.

---

## Use Case 3 — Capital Adequacy Monitoring (Basel)

### The Problem

Basel III and its successors impose complex capital adequacy requirements on banks. They must hold sufficient capital against risk-weighted assets, maintain appropriate liquidity coverage ratios, and meet leverage requirements. These ratios are sensitive to both internal portfolio composition and external market conditions — a credit rating downgrade of a single large counterparty can materially shift risk-weighted assets and capital requirements across the entire portfolio.

Current capital systems are predominantly retrospective — they calculate yesterday's position and report it. Memintel enables forward-looking capital monitoring — detecting when a combination of internal positions and external conditions is creating capital pressure before a ratio breach occurs.

### What the Alert Looks Like

```
🔴 Capital Alert — Counterparty Downgrade Impact

Counterparty:  GlobalTech Finance SA
Event:         Rating downgraded A- → BBB+ (S&P, 2024-03-15)
Exposure:      $340M (8.2% of total RWA)

Estimated RWA Impact:
  Pre-downgrade RWA:   $234M  (risk weight: 50%)
  Post-downgrade RWA:  $340M  (risk weight: 100%)
  RWA increase:        +$106M (+0.31% CET1 impact)

Current CET1 ratio:    11.2%
Post-event estimate:   10.89%  (management buffer: 11.0%)

→ Review hedging options   → Update capital plan   → Notify ALCO
```

### The Capital Adequacy Advantage

The `counterparty.exposure_pct_of_rwa` primitive is what makes this genuinely intelligent. When a counterparty is downgraded, the system does not just note the rating event — it immediately evaluates the capital impact by combining the downgrade signal with the counterparty's contribution to total RWA. A downgrade of a counterparty representing 0.3% of RWA is a routine monitoring item. A downgrade of a counterparty representing 8.2% of RWA may require immediate capital action. The Concept layer computes this distinction automatically.

## The System Response Loop (All Three Use Cases)

The evaluation loop is identical across all three use cases — only the primitives, concepts, and thresholds differ.

```
Trigger: Schedule (hourly/daily) OR event-driven
  (new transaction, rating event, regulatory update)
          ↓
For each entity in scope:
  Memintel calls resolvers with (entity_id, timestamp)
  Resolvers fetch point-in-time values from data sources
  Concept computation runs
  Condition evaluates
          ↓
  If condition fires:
    Action triggered — webhook, notification, SAR workflow
    Decision logged with full audit trail
    Alert delivered to analyst / officer
          ↓
  If not: Decision logged. No action.
          ↓
Next trigger
```

### Event-driven vs scheduled evaluation

AML is best run **event-driven** — evaluate at transaction time, not on a schedule. Delays in AML monitoring create regulatory exposure.

Credit risk is best run **daily or on financial submission** — borrower financials change slowly, but covenant proximity should be checked daily as market conditions affect collateral values.

Capital adequacy is best run **event-driven for rating changes** and **daily for ratio monitoring** — a rating event should trigger immediate evaluation; ratio trends are monitored daily.

```typescript
// AML — event-driven, fires on each transaction
const amlTask = await client.tasks.create({
    intent: "Alert on high-risk transactions",
    schedule: { type: "event", trigger: "transaction.created" },
    ...
});

// Credit — daily monitoring
const creditTask = await client.tasks.create({
    intent: "Early warning on DSCR deterioration",
    schedule: { frequency: "daily", time: "06:00" },
    ...
});

// Capital — event-driven for rating changes
const capitalTask = await client.tasks.create({
    intent: "Alert on large counterparty downgrade",
    schedule: { type: "event", trigger: "rating.changed" },
    ...
});
```

## Task Management

### User controls (same across all use cases)

```typescript
// View all active risk monitoring tasks
const tasks = await client.tasks.list({ owner: "current_user" });

// Pause AML task during scheduled system maintenance
await client.tasks.pause("tsk_aml_watch", {
    reason: "Transaction pipeline maintenance window 02:00-04:00"
});

// Check task performance metrics
const taskDetail = await client.tasks.get("tsk_credit_early_warning");
console.log(`Fired ${taskDetail.fire_count_30d} times in last 30 days`);
console.log(`False positive rate: ${taskDetail.false_positive_rate_30d}`);
```

### Admin visibility

```typescript
// Admin view — all tasks across all risk types
const allTasks = await adminClient.tasks.list();

// Filter by domain
const amlTasks     = await adminClient.tasks.list({ tag: "aml" });
const creditTasks  = await adminClient.tasks.list({ tag: "credit_risk" });
const capitalTasks = await adminClient.tasks.list({ tag: "capital" });

// Version distribution — critical for regulatory audits
// Regulator may ask: "which condition version was active on date X?"
const metrics = await adminClient.tasks.metrics({
    conditionId: "transaction.high_aml_risk"
});
console.log(metrics.version_distribution);
// { "1.0": 2, "1.1": 5, "1.2": 8 }
```

## Calibration

### AML calibration — driven by SAR outcomes

```typescript
// A transaction was flagged but SAR was not filed — false positive
await client.feedback.decision({
    conditionId: "transaction.high_aml_risk",
    conditionVersion: "1.1",
    entity: "txn_92847",
    timestamp: "2024-03-15T14:23:00Z",
    feedback: "false_positive",
    note: "Transaction consistent with known business pattern — documentary evidence collected"
});
```

### Credit calibration — driven by default events

```typescript
// A borrower defaulted that was not flagged — false negative
await client.feedback.decision({
    conditionId: "borrower.early_warning",
    conditionVersion: "1.0",
    entity: "borrower_4821",
    timestamp: "2023-09-30T00:00:00Z",
    feedback: "false_negative",
    note: "Borrower defaulted Q1 2024 — DSCR deterioration was not flagged early enough"
});
```

### Capital calibration — driven by supervisory findings

```typescript
// Supervisory review identified capital pressure that system missed
await client.feedback.decision({
    conditionId: "bank.capital_pressure",
    conditionVersion: "1.0",
    entity: "entity_001",
    timestamp: "2024-01-31T00:00:00Z",
    feedback: "false_negative",
    note: "SREP outcome identified capital concern — threshold too conservative"
});
```

The calibration request, impact review, and approval flow is identical across all three domains — see the [Deal Intelligence tutorial](/docs/tutorials/deal-intelligence#step-9----the-feedback-and-calibration-cycle) for the full flow.

## Application Context

Before creating primitives and tasks for this use case, define the application context so the LLM can compile accurate, domain-aware definitions. Financial risk monitoring spans three distinct sub-domains — each benefits from its own context.

**AML context:**

```json
{
  "domain": {
    "description": "Anti-money laundering transaction monitoring for a mid-size commercial bank. We monitor customer transaction patterns to detect money laundering, structuring, and other financial crimes.",
    "entities": [
      { "name": "customer",    "description": "a registered bank customer with an established transaction history" },
      { "name": "transaction", "description": "an individual payment, transfer, or cash event" }
    ],
    "decisions": ["sar_required", "enhanced_due_diligence", "account_review"]
  },
  "behavioural": {
    "data_cadence": "streaming",
    "meaningful_windows": { "min": "1d", "max": "90d" },
    "regulatory": ["BSA", "FinCEN", "FATF"]
  },
  "semantic_hints": [
    { "term": "unusual",     "definition": "materially different from the customer's established 90-day baseline" },
    { "term": "structuring", "definition": "multiple transactions designed to stay below $10,000 reporting threshold" }
  ],
  "calibration_bias": {
    "false_negative_cost": "high",
    "false_positive_cost": "medium"
  }
}
```

**Credit risk context:**

```json
{
  "domain": {
    "description": "Credit risk monitoring for a commercial lending portfolio. We monitor borrower financial health and covenant compliance to identify deterioration before breach.",
    "entities": [
      { "name": "borrower", "description": "a commercial borrower with an active loan facility" },
      { "name": "loan",     "description": "an individual credit facility with defined covenants" }
    ],
    "decisions": ["early_warning", "covenant_breach_risk", "watchlist_addition"]
  },
  "behavioural": {
    "data_cadence": "batch",
    "meaningful_windows": { "min": "30d", "max": "365d" },
    "regulatory": ["Basel-III", "CECL"]
  },
  "semantic_hints": [
    { "term": "deteriorating", "definition": "declining across two or more consecutive quarterly submissions" },
    { "term": "stressed",      "definition": "DSCR below 1.5x or leverage above 4x" }
  ],
  "calibration_bias": {
    "false_negative_cost": "high",
    "false_positive_cost": "low"
  }
}
```

The AML context uses `streaming` cadence and short windows (`1d` minimum) — appropriate for real-time transaction evaluation. The credit context uses `batch` cadence and long windows (`365d` maximum) — appropriate for quarterly financial submissions. The compiler uses these to select appropriate time-series strategies and window parameters automatically.

## Why This Architecture Fits Financial Risk

All three use cases share the same structural property: **the risk signal requires evaluating internal state against an evolving external environment.**

AML requires evaluating a transaction against both the customer's historical pattern (internal) and current watchlists and typologies (external). A rule-based system sees the transaction in isolation. Memintel sees it in context.

Credit risk requires evaluating a borrower's financials against both their own historical trajectory (internal) and current market conditions and sector stress (external). A covenant monitoring system fires when a breach occurs. Memintel fires when a breach is approaching.

Capital adequacy requires evaluating portfolio positions against both current capital ratios (internal) and evolving risk weights, rating events, and regulatory requirements (external). A capital reporting system tells you where you are. Memintel tells you where you are heading.

The auditability requirement is the other shared property. In all three domains, every decision must be defensible — to auditors, to regulators, to courts. AML SAR filings require documented decision basis. Credit decisions require documented risk assessment trails. Capital calculations require reproducible methodology. Memintel's deterministic, immutable audit trail — logging every evaluation with its exact concept version, condition version, primitive values, and timestamp — produces this documentation automatically.
