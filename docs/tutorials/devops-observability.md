# Tutorial: DevOps and Observability

A walkthrough of two critical SRE use cases — deployment risk monitoring and incident early warning with SLO breach prediction. Together they cover the two most consequential moments in a production system's lifecycle: when something changes, and when something is going wrong.

:::note What you'll build
Two deterministic monitoring systems that continuously evaluate your production environment — detecting deployment risk before it materialises and predicting SLO breaches before they occur — with every decision auditable, consistent, and reproducible across environments.
:::

---

## Why Observability Needs Memintel

SRE teams already have observability tooling — metrics, traces, logs, dashboards. The problem is not data. The problem is **signal extraction from noise at scale**.

Current alerting systems are rules-based: if error rate exceeds 1%, page someone. This approach has two well-known failure modes that every SRE team lives with:

**Alert fatigue** — rules fire constantly on thresholds that are technically breached but contextually normal. Engineers learn to ignore alerts. The one that matters gets missed.

**Late detection** — by the time a static threshold is crossed, the degradation has been underway for hours. The intervention window has already narrowed. The incident is no longer preventable — it is only recoverable.

Both failures have the same root cause: **the rules were written against a specific understanding of what "bad" looks like that may not match the current system's behaviour, and nobody updated them.**

Memintel addresses this differently. Instead of asking an engineer to specify what failure looks like, you express what reliability means — and the system continuously evaluates whether the trajectory of your environment is consistent with that.

## The Three Roles

| Role | Who they are | What they do |
|---|---|---|
| **Data Engineer** | Platform / observability team | Builds metric pipelines, writes resolver functions, delivers typed primitives from observability stack |
| **Admin** | SRE lead / platform owner | Maintains config files — primitives, guardrails — governs strategy registry and severity priors |
| **User** | SRE / on-call engineer | Expresses intent via internal tooling — creates, monitors, and manages monitoring tasks |

## Use Case 1 — Deployment Risk Monitoring

### The Problem

Every deployment is a risk event. Even with CI/CD, canary releases, and feature flags, deployments introduce the most common source of production incidents. The challenge is that deployment risk is not binary — it is a function of what changed, what the current system state is, and what patterns previous deployments with similar characteristics have shown.

Current approaches are either too conservative (block everything) or too permissive (ship and watch). What is missing is a continuous assessment of deployment risk that accounts for the specific characteristics of this deployment, this service, and this moment in the production environment.

### The Architecture Boundary

```
Raw signals   →  Signal Extraction  →  Primitives  →  Memintel
(CI/CD events,   (diff analysis,       (typed,          (deterministic
 metrics,         change scoring,       normalised)       risk evaluation)
 test results)    LLM on changelogs)

### User Creates Tasks

```typescript
// SRE lead creates deployment monitoring tasks via internal deployment portal

// Task 1 — High-risk deployment gate
const deploymentRisk = await client.tasks.create({
    intent: "Alert me when a deployment carries significant risk based on change size, service history, and current environment state",
    entityScope: "all_production_deployments",
    delivery: {
        type: "webhook",
        endpoint: "https://myapp.com/hooks/deployment-risk"
    },
    dryRun: true
});

// System resolves to composite condition:
// changelog_risk_score + similar_incident_rate + service_error_rate
// weighted by has_db_migration, is_peak_traffic_window, days_since_last_deploy

// Task 2 — Immediate block: deploying into active incident
const activeIncidentBlock = await client.tasks.create({
    intent: "Alert me immediately when someone attempts to deploy to a service with an active incident",
    entityScope: "all_production_deployments",
    delivery: {
        type: "webhook",

    intent: "Alert me when a significant deployment is scheduled during peak traffic",
    entityScope: "all_production_deployments",
    delivery: {
        type: "webhook",

    }
});
// Resolves to: is_peak_traffic_window = true AND lines_changed > 500
```

### What the Alert Looks Like

```
⚠️ Deployment Risk Alert — High Risk Detected

Service:      payment-service  (v2.4.1 → v2.4.2)
Deployment:   deploy_9f3k2m
Triggered by: @sarah.chen  |  14:23 UTC

Risk Factors:
  • DB migration included          — schema change detected
  • 847 lines changed              — above medium threshold (500)
  • Changelog risk score: 0.71     — "refactored payment retry logic"
  • Similar deployments:           — 28% caused incidents in last 90 days
  • Current error rate: 0.41%      — elevated baseline (normal: 0.12%)
  • Peak traffic window:           — 14:00-16:00 is historically high traffic

Overall risk score:  0.79  (threshold: 0.65)

Recommendation: Consider delaying to off-peak window (after 18:00 UTC)
or enabling canary release with 5% traffic split.

→ Proceed anyway   → Delay deployment   → Switch to canary   → Cancel
```

### The Deployment Risk Advantage

The `deployment.similar_deployment_incident_rate` primitive is what makes this genuinely intelligent rather than just threshold-based. A deployment with a database migration to a service that has had 28% of similar deployments cause incidents is categorically different from a deployment with a database migration to a service that has never had a migration-related incident. The system distinguishes between these automatically — not because a rule was written for each service, but because the historical pattern is encoded in the primitive and the intent "significant risk" incorporates it.

---

## Use Case 2 — Incident Early Warning and SLO Breach Prediction

### The Problem

SLO breaches are almost never sudden. They are the end state of a gradual degradation that began hours or days before the threshold was crossed. By the time a static alert fires, the error budget may already be significantly consumed, the on-call engineer is paged into an already-critical situation, and the investigation starts from scratch.

The SRE team does not need to be told the SLO was breached. They need to be told the SLO is *going to be* breached — with enough lead time to investigate and intervene before users are impacted.

Current signals:
  Error rate:     0.41%  (SLO threshold: 0.10%)
  p99 latency:    284ms  (baseline: 112ms — 2.5x elevated)
  Saturation:     0.71   (approaching high threshold)
  Recent deploy:  Yes    (payment-service v2.4.2 — 47 mins ago)

Pattern match:  0.68 similarity to pre-incident patterns (last incident: 2023-11-14)

→ Open investigation   → Check recent deployment   → Rollback   → Silence 30m
```

**Memory leak alert:**
```
⚠️ SLO Early Warning — Memory Leak Detected

Service:      user-session-service
Triggered:    09:23 UTC

Memory trend (last 2 hours):
  07:23: 61.2%  →  08:23: 68.7%  →  09:23: 76.1%
  Rate of increase: +7.4% per hour (linear — consistent with leak)

At current rate:
  OOM likely:    ~3.2 hours  (12:30 UTC)
  Service impact: downstream auth-service and api-gateway affected

Recent changes:
  Last deployment: user-session-service v1.8.3  (yesterday 16:45 UTC)
  Changed: session cache TTL logic refactored

→ Profile memory   → Check heap dump   → Rollback to v1.8.2   → Scale horizontally
```

### The SLO Monitoring Advantage

Two primitives make this qualitatively different from threshold alerting:

**`service.error_budget_burn_rate_1h`** converts the abstract SLO into a concrete rate of consumption. A burn rate of 6.2x tells the SRE that at the current pace, the entire monthly error budget will be consumed in 4.8 days — not that the error rate is 0.41%. This is the framing that drives action. Nobody acts on "error rate is 0.41% and the SLO is 0.1%." Everyone acts on "we will breach our SLO in 18 hours at this rate."

**`service.similar_incident_pattern_score`** is the most powerful primitive in this system. Instead of writing rules for every failure mode, the system learns from historical incident data what the pre-incident signal fingerprint looks like — and fires when the current fingerprint resembles it. The SRE does not need to enumerate every possible failure pattern. They express "alert me when this looks like it's going wrong" and the system matches against the evidence of what "going wrong" has looked like before.

## The System Response Loop

```
Trigger: Every 5 minutes (metrics) OR event-driven (deployment events)
          ↓
For each service in scope:
  Resolvers fetch point-in-time values:
    → Metrics API: error_rate, latency, memory, CPU
    → SLO pipeline: budget remaining, burn rate
    → CI pipeline: recent deployment flag
    → Pattern matcher: similarity to past incidents
  Concept computation runs:
    → Composite saturation score
    → Burn rate calculation
    → Trend analysis on time-series primitives
  Condition evaluates
          ↓
  If fired:
    Alert delivered with context — not just "threshold breached"
    Decision logged with full audit trail
    Runbook link attached based on condition type
          ↓
  If not: Decision logged. No alert.
          ↓
Next 5-minute tick
```

### Event-driven vs scheduled

| Task | Best trigger | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| Deployment risk | Event-driven on deployment creation | Risk assessment needed before deployment proceeds |
| Active incident block | Event-driven on deployment creation | Immediate — must fire before deployment starts |
| Error budget burn rate | Every 5 minutes | Budget consumption is continuous |
| Error rate trend | Every 5 minutes | Trend needs consistent sampling interval |
| Memory leak | Every 5 minutes | Linear growth requires regular sampling to detect slope |
| Pattern match | Every 5 minutes | Pattern similarity changes as signals evolve |

## Task Management

### User controls

```typescript
// View all active SLO monitoring tasks
const tasks = await client.tasks.list({ owner: "current_user" });

// Silence a task during a known maintenance window
await client.tasks.pause("tsk_slo_burn_rate_checkout", {
    reason: "Planned maintenance window 02:00-04:00 UTC — expected elevated errors"
});

// Check alert performance — are we getting too many false positives?
const taskDetail = await client.tasks.get("tsk_error_rate_trend");
console.log(`Fired ${taskDetail.fire_count_7d} times in last 7 days`);
console.log(`False positive rate: ${taskDetail.false_positive_rate_7d}`);
console.log(`Avg lead time before incident: ${taskDetail.avg_lead_time_minutes} mins`);
```

### Admin visibility

```typescript
// Admin view — alert volume and quality across all services
const metrics = await adminClient.tasks.metrics({
    tag: "slo_monitoring"
});

console.log(metrics.total_alerts_7d);          // 847
console.log(metrics.false_positive_rate);       // 0.23 — 23% false positive rate
console.log(metrics.avg_lead_time_minutes);     // 34 — average 34 mins before incident
console.log(metrics.incidents_caught_early);    // 12 of 14 incidents had prior warning

// Version distribution — are teams on the latest calibrated conditions?
console.log(metrics.version_distribution);
// { "1.0": 8, "1.1": 23, "1.2": 41 }  — most teams on latest version

// Suspend tasks if metrics pipeline is unreliable
await adminClient.tasks.suspend("tsk_memory_leak_all_services", {
    reason: "Memory metrics pipeline outage — data unreliable until 15:00 UTC"
});
```

---

## Calibration

### Deployment risk — driven by post-deployment incident data

```typescript
// A deployment was flagged as high-risk but deployed without incident — false positive
await client.feedback.decision({
    conditionId: "deployment.high_risk",
    conditionVersion: "1.1",
    entity: "deploy_9f3k2m",
    timestamp: "2024-03-15T14:23:00Z",
    feedback: "false_positive",
    note: "Deployment completed without incident — DB migrations for this service are low risk"
});
```

### SLO monitoring — driven by incident retrospectives

```typescript
// An incident occurred that was not predicted — false negative
// Memory was not flagged even though leak had been running for 3 hours
await client.feedback.decision({
    conditionId: "service.memory_leak_risk",
    conditionVersion: "1.0",
    entity: "user-session-service",
    timestamp: "2024-03-12T07:00:00Z",
    feedback: "false_negative",
    note: "Memory leak started at 07:00 — OOM occurred at 11:30 — not caught early enough"
});

// Admin reviews calibration recommendation
const cal = await adminClient.conditions.calibrate({
    conditionId: "service.memory_leak_risk",
    conditionVersion: "1.0",
});

console.log(cal.recommended_params);
// { monotonic_increase_threshold: 5.0 }  — reduced from 7.4% per hour to 5%
// Catches the leak earlier in its progression

console.log(cal.impact.delta_alerts);   // +3 per week
// Slightly more alerts but catches leaks 90 mins earlier on average
```

```
SETUP (one time)
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Data Engineer:   Configure metrics pipeline resolvers
Data Engineer:   Configure CI/CD event pipeline resolvers
Data Engineer:   Build pattern matcher against incident history
Admin:           Define primitives → memintel_primitives_deployment.yaml
                                     memintel_primitives_slo.yaml
Admin:           Define guardrails  → memintel_guardrails_deployment.yaml

System:          Load config at startup


DEPLOYMENT RISK EVALUATION
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Deployment event created in CI/CD
  → Memintel evaluates immediately
  → Risk score computed from change size, service history, environment state
  → If high risk: alert fires before deployment proceeds
  → Engineer decides: proceed, delay, switch to canary, or cancel


ONGOING SLO MONITORING LOOP
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Every 5 minutes:
  → Resolvers fetch current metrics, SLO state, pattern scores
  → Concept computation: burn rate, trend analysis, pattern matching
  → Conditions evaluate
  → If fired: contextual alert with lead time estimate and runbook link
  → If not: decision logged, no alert


TASK MANAGEMENT
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
User:    View / pause / resume own tasks
         (e.g. pause during planned maintenance windows)
Admin:   View alert volume and quality across all services
Admin:   Suspend tasks during metrics pipeline outages
Admin:   Deprecate condition versions after calibration


CALIBRATION CYCLE
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Ground truth: incident retrospectives, post-deployment reviews
User:    Submit feedback (false positive / false negative)
Admin:   Review calibration recommendation + lead time impact
Admin:   Approve → new condition version (immutable)
User:    Rebind task to new version (explicit, never automatic)
         ↓

## Application Context

Before creating primitives and tasks for this use case, define the application context so the LLM can compile accurate, domain-aware monitoring definitions.

**SRE / SLO monitoring context:**

```json
{
  "domain": {
    "description": "Production reliability monitoring for a cloud-native SaaS platform. We monitor service health and SLO compliance to detect degradation before it impacts customers.",
    "entities": [
      { "name": "service",    "description": "a production microservice with defined SLOs" },
      { "name": "deployment", "description": "a code or configuration change deployed to production" }
    ],
    "decisions": ["slo_breach_risk", "deployment_block", "incident_early_warning", "memory_leak"]
  },
  "behavioural": {
    "data_cadence": "streaming",
    "meaningful_windows": { "min": "5m", "max": "24h" }
  },
  "semantic_hints": [
    { "term": "degradation",     "definition": "sustained increase in error rate or latency over at least 15 minutes" },
    { "term": "high risk deploy", "definition": "includes DB migration, dependency update, or >500 lines changed" },
    { "term": "peak traffic",    "definition": "14:00-18:00 UTC weekdays based on historical p95 traffic patterns" }
  ],
  "calibration_bias": {
    "false_negative_cost": "high",
    "false_positive_cost": "medium"
  }
}
```

The `streaming` cadence and short minimum window (`5m`) tell the compiler this is a real-time monitoring context — it will prefer event-driven strategies and short evaluation windows over batch approaches. The semantic hint for "degradation" means "alert me when this service shows early signs of degradation" compiles to a sustained trend condition, not a single-point threshold breach. `false_negative_cost: high` because a missed incident early warning is worse than a brief false page.

## Why This Architecture Fits SRE

Both use cases share the same structural property: **the risk signal requires evaluating current state against historical pattern, not just against a static threshold.**

Deployment risk requires evaluating this deployment against the history of similar deployments to this service — with similar change characteristics, at similar times, in similar environment states. A threshold on lines changed is noise. A threshold on "lines changed to a service whose similar deployments caused incidents 28% of the time" is signal.

SLO breach prediction requires evaluating current metrics against the trajectory — not the current value. An error rate of 0.41% below a 1.0% SLO threshold is fine in isolation. An error rate that has risen from 0.08% to 0.41% in 90 minutes, with a burn rate of 6.2x, while memory is climbing linearly and the signal pattern resembles the last three incidents — that is a page that should have gone out 30 minutes ago.

Static thresholds fire when something is already wrong. Memintel fires when something is **becoming** wrong — which is the only framing that gives an SRE team enough time to prevent an incident rather than just respond to one.
